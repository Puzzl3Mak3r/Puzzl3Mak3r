**`Indie Programmer and Digital Artist`**

I'm an indie highschool game developer who builds many projects and games for fun. I also make and edit digital art, but you're mainly hear to know the coding bit. I have started off learning C# before migrating to Psych Engine (modded) LUA, then regular LUA [for Solar 2D]. I have a channel on YouTube for kicking off an Indie game my friends and I are making. For the few people who want to read this, I'm also a coder for Psych Engine for LUA, but cannot use Haxe, but will try in the future. My preferred language is LUA.
